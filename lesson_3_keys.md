# HTTP 
  - Functioning of web as combination of multiple technologies.

## Application Layer
  - Not application itself
    - Set of protocols providing communication services to applications.  
      - Protocols at this layer most directly interact with application.
  
  ### Primary Concern 
    - Focus on the structure of the message and data it should contain. 
      - Relies on lower level protocols to handle establishment and flow of communications.
        - How message gets from point A to point B

  ### Application Layer Protocols 
    - Rules for how applications communicate at at syntactical level. 
      - Many different protocols at Application layer depending on use case. 
        - HTTP primary protocol for web communications

  #### Internet vs Web
    - Internet
      - network of networks
      - physical infrastructure and protocols that allow infrastructure to function
        - Ultimate goal is communication between networks.
    - World Wide Web
      - *service* accessed via the internet.
      - vast information system comprised of resources
        - navigable by URL 
    **HTTP is primary means for applications to interact with resources that comprise the web**

  
  #### Web Background/History 
    - Information system of structured resources connected by hyperlinks. 
      - Uniformity necessary for: 
        - rendered viewing
        - easily located
        - request standardization 
      
      - Initially achieved by combination of HTML, URI, and HTTP.

        - HTML
          - Hypertext Markup Language
            - structuring text documents 
              - used anchor element and href attribute to link to other resources. 

        - URI 
          - Uniform Resource Identifier
            - string of characters identifying particular resource.

        - HTTP 
          - Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
            - set of rules providing uniformity to transfer of resources between applications.
              - agreement or message format for how machines communicate with each other. 
            - Request-Response Protocol
